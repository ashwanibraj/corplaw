Past 5 years have been challenging times for financial market laws in India. The era has been characterized by many instances of misuse of the loopholes in laws. Some were so grave that they resulted in not only eroding the confidence of the investor in the market, but also in posing a threat to the credibility of the industry as a whole. They forced us to revamp our laws so as to discourage such practices in the future. It led to a complete overhaul of the Companies Act, 1956, significant changes being introduced to the laws relating to securities market, giving more powers to the regulators and introducing new investigating agencies, like SFIO and Economic Offence Units. However, the validity, adequacy and future implications of these changes are still uncertain. The present conference aims to dissolve this uncertainty through academic discourse.

The conference is being organized by Corporate Law Forum, which is an initiative by the students of National Law University, Odisha. For more information on CLF, please visit About CLF.
