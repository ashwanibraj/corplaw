I am a software engineer. Really interested in programming, my interests drew me to the scripting language python and thus, to the python web framework, Django. This is my experiment with Django and python. 
Moving forward, I am looking to pursue an MS in CS from a reputed college. Next goal for profile building and knowledge gain is to learn the language Go. Google developed language, the future for this seems good. I am sure to dedicate a page of this site to Go.
All this is coming after a satisfactory career and descent salary. The motivation that has been driving me all throughout is learning new stuff, specially related to computers. It has been and will be my passion in the days to come. 
Learning should never stop!!!
