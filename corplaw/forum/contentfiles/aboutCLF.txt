Corporate Law Forum is a student run organization which promotes discussions on legal issues of practical and academic concern related to corporate law. Our primary objective is to promote interest in Corporate Law and spread awareness about the subject. We also encourage students to take up research on issues related to the subject. 

CLF provides a platform to students which give them the advantage of accessing a pool of ideas and different outlooks on any given question related to corporate law. It works by assimilating differing views of all participants and members, and then making it available to all. This, in turn, becomes the best avenue for any person interested in doing research on corporate law to receive regular critical appraisals on his work. 

At CLF, we hold weekly discussions, provide regular updates through social media and organize conferences, seminars and workshops. We also invite professionals and practitioners to discuss about the practical nuances of Corporate Law. Participation in the activities of the forum is open for all.
