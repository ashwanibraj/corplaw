The role of a market regulator is that of a guardian, who has been endowed with the duty to protect the investors against probable repercussions arising out of the activities of unscrupulous traders. A plethora of financial laws that exist, are the tools in the hands of the regulator through which it performs its duties. The cardinal objective of such laws is to ensure that the markets remain fair, efficient and transparent. This objective is closely linked to investor protection and to the prevention of improper trading practices. A question often faced by the market regulators is, ‘how successful have they been in achieving this objective?’

The recent experiences may lead one to conclude that the objective is far from being achieved. From Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi Scheme to some of the most infamous insider trading cases (Galleon Group and SAC Capital), the financial crisis of 2008 has unmasked several capital market scams across the world. India has also not remained untouched from this upheaval. The era has seen fall of giants like Satyam on allegations of market manipulations by fudging accounts. It also witnessed a quake in the den of illegal chit funds that were till now comfortably running ponzis. Lately, Reliance Industries has also come under the scanner for alleged insider trading, which it is trying to avoid by resorting to the consent mechanism. Of all these, Sahara Investor Fraud seems to have gathered most of the eyeballs.

The Satyam Saga has taught us several unforgettable lessons. It resulted in an overhaul of corporate governance norms. However, it has now been realized that reforms are necessary in other branches of financial market laws as well. Ponzi schemes, being run under the garb of chit funds, have posed questions of more fundamental nature. These ponzis were successful in not only dodging the jurisdiction of SEBI, but also went unnoticed from the eyes of respective State Governments. SEBI also faced jurisdictional issues in the Sahara Investor Fraud. Of late, 
questions have also been raised over the regulator’s capabilities in dealing with problems posed by the next generational issues, like high frequency trading. The question which arises out of all this is whether investor education the apt solution to this or should there be stricter regulatory oversight? How much helpful are the new powers of SEBI in this regard? 

Instances of financial fraud do not only result in a loss of capital, but also leads to lowering investor confidence. With lesser capital available and lesser number of people willing to invest, companies are left with fewer avenues to raise money to finance their activities. With less finance available, productivity of the whole economy falls leading to a slump in economic growth. Therefore, efforts must be made to prevent financial markets abuse.

In India, number of cases taken up for investigation by SEBI in 2012-13 has increased by more than six times in comparison to 2007-08. What make the regulator’s task even more difficult are conflicts in jurisdiction as well as lack of sufficient powers. All these evidences have reignited the debate over the adequacy and sufficiency of laws regulating the financial markets.

The theme of this conference seeks to elicit alternative approaches for preventing market abuses of all kinds, including market manipulation, price rigging, insider trading, issue related manipulation, etc. The following questions might be taken up as a rough starting point for 
reflection:

(1) Is the present legal system sufficient to deal with the growing number of cases involving market abuses? If not, then should we have a stricter regulatory regime in place or should we look for alternative ways, like empowering investors with more rights?

(2) What are the problems involved with the implementation of securities law and what is its contribution in ensuring the proper functioning of market?

(3)What should be done with regard to the jurisdictional problems faced by market regulators?

(4) What kinds of changes are required to the laws concerning ponzi schemes to adequately protect investors’ interests?

(5) In comparison with their foreign counterparts, are the Indian regulators equipped with sufficient powers to efficiently deal with the ever evolving techniques of fraudsters?

(6) Are the recent amendments to the consent mechanism in SEBI sufficient to address the problems before it?

(7)What is the role played by Serious Fraud Investigation Office, Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, Economic Offence Units, etc. in bringing the culprits of financial frauds to justice?

(8)What is the constitutionality of various Economic Offence Units of different State Governments?

(9) Whether the Companies Act, 2013 provides for adequate safeguards against financial malpractices?

(10) How important is the modern day concern of making financial laws compatible with human rights to the regulators and what is its effect?

(11) What is the present legal status of high frequency trading? How harmful can they be to the fair and efficient working of the financial market?
